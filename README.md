# Startup Idea Finder
Developed an automated workflow in n8n that scrapes specific subreddits to identify user-reported issues related to a particular product or service. These problems are then processed by the Gemini Flash 8B model, which generates corresponding solutions. The final output â€” a structured list of problems and their respective AI-generated solutions is automatically logged into a Google Sheet for easy reference and analysis.
It could be tried with multiple subreddits (I tried with 3).

Here's the Workflow diagram on n8n:
